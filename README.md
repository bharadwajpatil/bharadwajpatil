## 🚀 Projects  

### 🔹 **1. Speed Car Detection System**  
A computer vision project that detects vehicles in real-time using **YOLO + OpenCV**,  
tracks them across frames, calculates their movement, and estimates vehicle **speed (km/h)**  
using pixel-to-meter calibration.  
**Tech Used:** Python, YOLO (Ultralytics), OpenCV, NumPy  
**Features:**  
- Vehicle detection  
- Real-time tracking  
- Speed estimation  
- Bounding box visualization  

### 🔹 2. Student Dropout Prediction System

A machine learning-based system that predicts whether a student is at risk of dropping out based on academic, demographic, and behavioral data.
The model analyzes patterns in student performance, attendance, engagement, and socioeconomic factors to generate early warning alerts.

Tech Used: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Features:

Data preprocessing & feature engineering

Machine learning model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Early warning risk prediction (Low/Medium/High)

Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)

Visualization of student performance patterns
